# Desktop-Translator-for-European-Languages
The main idea behind this project is to make an user friendly translator that can take any language as an input and give us the spoken input sentence in our desired output language. To start with, we’ve defined our project specifically for the europian union and would like to make various versions of the same for asian, american and other unions as well. We also have an user friendly interface that makes it easier for the user who’s concerned only with his translation and not the back-end code running behind.
